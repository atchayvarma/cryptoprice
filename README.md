# CrpytoPriceBot 

## Description

Hi 👋🏼,

I am Atchay Varma, I have created a twitter bot 🤖, which tweets the💵 price of top 5 🪙 crypto currencies every hour along with their price 💹 change in last 60 mins ⌚. This data is collected from CoinMarketCap API. The price displayed will be in USD 💰

I made it just for learning purpose. This bot is created with NodeJs. And hosted in Azure (Functions)⚡ with the the help of Timer Trigger which gets triggered ⏳ one hour once.
